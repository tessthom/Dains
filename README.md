# Dain's Place

A local bar and restaurant has been frustrated by an outdated, clunky SquareSpace site that hasn't been updated in years. I'm building a new, streamlined site using Astro with vanilla JS. 

All designs were created by me, using Figma. I am also acting as a copywriter and photographer to generate fresh content and better quality assets for the new build.

| Tool                   | Reason                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| [Astro](https://docs.astro.build)             | Excellent SSG features + super flexible components                            |
| [OpenProps](https://open-props.style/)             | Lightweight, powerful CSS variables      |
| Vanilla JS           | Why add overhead when Astro supercharges what "static sites" can do?          |
