# Dain's Place

A local bar and restaurant has been frustrated by an outdated, clunky SquareSpace site that hasn't been updated in years. They want to integrate a CMS one day, but for now just need a better static site. 

In an attempt to operate in the sweet spot between speed and quality, I'm building a new site using Astro. The Dx and ease of setup has been great so far. I love that I can pass props, nest components and layouts, and easily incorporate a CMS and/or framework down the line, should my client's needs change. It feels like just the right tool for a future-proof refresh.

All designs were created by me, using Figma. I am also acting as copywriter and photographer to generate fresh content and better quality assets for the new build.

| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| [Astro](https://docs.astro.build)             | Excellent SSG features + super flexible components                            |
| [OpenProps](https://open-props.style/)             | Lightweight, powerful CSS variables      |
| Vanilla JS           | Why add overhead when Astro supercharges what "static sites" can do?          |
