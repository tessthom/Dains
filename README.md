# Dain's Place

A local bar and restaurant has been frustrated by an outdated, clunky SquareSpace site that hasn't been updated in years. They want a new site that follows current day best practices, and are interested in integrating a CMS in the future to keep content like menus fresh.

In an attempt to operate in the sweet spot between efficiency and quality, I'm building a new site using Astro. The Dx and ease of setup has been great so far. I love that I can pass props, nest components and layouts, and easily incorporate a CMS and/or framework down the line as my client's goals scale. It feels like just the right tool for developing a future-proof refresh that I can get up and running ASAP.

All designs were created by me, using Figma. I am also acting as copywriter and photographer to generate fresh, SEO-aware content and better quality assets for the new build.

## Features

- Mobile-first, responsive design using
- Contact form with client-side validation
- Clean, modern layout with custom animations
