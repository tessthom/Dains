		<p class="body-text">The man, the myth, the legend... Dain Phelan beep bop and a table top. This is the first paragraph about Dain. It will probably have a fun quote between itself and a second paragraph. There are some good ones from the Indy Weekly profile on Dain from back in 2014 where he talks about Sam Malone being an idol and making decorations for the bar starting in 6th grade. How cute is that! Lorem borem ipsum. </p>

		<blockquote cite="https://indyweek.com/food-and-drink/cheers-dain-phelan-s-place/">"All I ever wanted to do is open a bar."</blockquote>

		<p class="body-text">So in 2007, on his 69th birthday, that's exactly what Dain did. In the years since, 754 Ninth Street has become a genuine Durham institution - a lively, welcoming refuge for locals, students, and visitors alike, where you're sure to be greeted with a smile (and a wise crack if we really like ya).</p>
